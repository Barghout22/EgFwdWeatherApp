# Weather App Journal

## project overview

This project is part of the **EgFwd\udacity NanoDegree curiculum**.
In this project I take a zip code from the website user and use that to get them the weather condition ,
save it with the current date and their feeling input into our server and then display it on the webpage.

### technical steps

- I use _async fetch_ to move this data back and forth by chaining multiple promises.
- I create my server using _node_,_express_ and I installed _cors_ and _body-parser_ on it as middleware.
- I set up **GET** and **POST** routes in my server to facilitate saving and providing data to the clinet side
  using the express _get_ and _post_ methods.
